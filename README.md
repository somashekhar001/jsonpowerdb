JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation which is light-weighted designed such that humans can easily read data interchange and its execution.

Easy to use

JSON syntax is very easy to use. We have to use only -> as a syntax which provides us an easy parsing of the data and faster execution of the data. Since its syntax is very small and light weighted that’s the reason that it executes the response in the faster way.
Data sharing tools

JSON is the best tool for the sharing data of any size even audio, video, etc. This is because JSON stores the data in the arrays so data transfer makes easier. For this reason, JSON is a superior file format for web APIs and for web development.
Schema support

It has a wide range of supported browser compatibility with the operating systems so the applications made with the coding of JSON doesn’t require much effort to make it all browser compatible. During development, the developer thinks for the different browsers but JSON provides that functionality.
Server parsing

On the server side parsing is the important part that developers want if the parsing will be fast on the server side then the only user can get the fast response of their response so in this case JSON server-side parsing is the strong point that indicates us to use the JSON on the server side.
Objects align in code

JSON objects and code objects match, which is beneficial when quickly creating domain objects in dynamic languages.
